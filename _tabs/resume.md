## What drive me in life? 

**What's really important to me?** **How do I want to be remembered?** **What gives me energy?** are the questions that I pose myself every day, and the short answer is helping people in a digital world where information and technology has a huge impact in human on day-to-day activity.

One of things I've learned overtime is that we need have financial incentives to drive performance and that financials incentives actually deteriorate performance.  We need to rely on create the right environment where people want to give their best. This goes from training environment to technology tools. So to top of our customer value proposition, the definition of the employees value proposition. We need to think that's going to be the big differentiator for companies.

I have a deep-seated passion for data and marketing, fields that are dynamic and rich with opportunities for innovation and insight. The journey in these areas is fueled by an unwavering commitment to not only expand me personal knowledge but also to master these domains to such an extent that I can distill complex concepts into simpler, more understandable forms.

I have expertise spans across various facets of data analysis and marketing strategies. This includes harnessing the power of big data, employing advanced analytical techniques, and understanding market trends to drive decision-making and create value. I leverage statistical tools and marketing metrics to not only predict consumer behavior but also to craft compelling narratives that resonate with diverse audiences.

What sets me apart is the dedication to continual learning. I constantly seek out new knowledge, staying abreast of the latest trends and technologies in both fields. This continuous expansion of the skill set is not solely for personal growth; it's also about empowering others. By breaking down sophisticated topics into easier-to-grasp concepts, I help peers and other people alike to light up with "aha" moments, fostering a learning environment that is both informative and inspiring.
