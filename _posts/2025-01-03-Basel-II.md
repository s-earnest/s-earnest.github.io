**Basel II** is a set of international banking regulations established by the **Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)** that provides guidelines on how much capital banks need to hold to safeguard against financial and operational risks. Basel II was introduced in 2004 and aimed to improve upon the original **Basel I** framework. It is primarily focused on strengthening the regulation, supervision, and risk management within the banking sector.

### Key Components of Basel II Regulations

1. **Three Pillars of Basel II**  
   Basel II introduced a three-pillar approach to ensure comprehensive risk management in banks:

   - **Pillar 1: Minimum Capital Requirements**  
     This pillar sets out the minimum capital banks must hold against various risks, including:
     - **Credit Risk**: Risk of loss due to a borrower's failure to meet obligations.
     - **Market Risk**: Risk of loss due to changes in market prices or conditions.
     - **Operational Risk**: Risk of loss due to inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, people, or external events.

     Banks are required to hold capital based on a set of risk-weighted assets (RWA) that reflect the inherent risks in their loan portfolios and other assets.

   - **Pillar 2: Supervisory Review Process**  
     This pillar emphasizes the need for supervisory authorities to review and assess how banks are managing their risks and whether they hold enough capital to absorb unexpected losses. Regulators are encouraged to evaluate internal risk management processes, including the strategies banks use to manage and mitigate credit, market, and operational risks.

   - **Pillar 3: Market Discipline**  
     This pillar aims to increase transparency in the banking system. Banks are required to disclose more information about their risk exposures, capital adequacy, and risk management practices. By doing so, market participants can better assess the financial health and risk profile of banks, which promotes accountability and encourages prudent behavior.

2. **Risk Management and Capital Adequacy**  
   Basel II introduced more sophisticated methodologies for calculating capital requirements for credit risk, including the following approaches:
   
   - **Standardized Approach**: Banks use external credit ratings to assess the risk-weighted assets (RWA) of different asset classes (e.g., loans or bonds). The ratings from credit agencies like S&P or Moodyâ€™s help determine the capital reserve requirements.
   
   - **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) Approach**: Banks use their internal risk models and ratings to estimate the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) for each asset class. The IRB approach allows banks to calculate capital charges based on their own internal risk assessments, which is more tailored than the standardized approach.

3. **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**  
   Basel II requires banks to maintain a **capital adequacy ratio** (CAR) of at least 8%, which ensures that banks have enough capital to cover their risks. The CAR is calculated as the ratio of a bank's capital to its risk-weighted assets (RWA):

   \[
   \text{CAR} = \frac{\text{Capital}}{\text{Risk-Weighted Assets}} \times 100
   \]

   This ratio ensures that the bank can absorb potential losses in a stressed environment.

4. **The Three Types of Risk**  
   Basel II requires banks to manage and hold capital against three main types of risk:
   
   - **Credit Risk**: The risk that a borrower will default on a loan or other credit obligation.
   - **Market Risk**: The risk that a bank will incur losses due to changes in market conditions, such as interest rates, stock prices, or foreign exchange rates.
   - **Operational Risk**: The risk of loss resulting from failed internal processes, systems, or external events, such as fraud, cyberattacks, or natural disasters.

5. **The Use of Internal Models**  
   Basel II encourages the use of internal models for risk management. Under the **Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) approach**, banks are allowed to develop their own models for estimating key credit risk parameters like **Probability of Default (PD)**, **Loss Given Default (LGD)**, and **Exposure at Default (EAD)**, provided that these models meet regulatory standards and are properly validated by supervisors.

6. **Securitization**  
   Basel II introduced guidelines for the treatment of **securitization exposures**. Banks must hold additional capital for the risk associated with securitization transactions (e.g., asset-backed securities), especially if they retain some of the risk (such as holding junior tranches).

7. **Regulatory Arbitrage Concerns**  
   Basel II aimed to address the issue of **regulatory arbitrage**, where banks might structure their portfolios to minimize capital charges by exploiting differences in regulatory frameworks. The regulations encourage a more uniform approach to risk measurement and capital adequacy.

### Basel II vs. Basel III
While Basel II focused on setting minimum capital requirements, Basel III, introduced after the 2008 financial crisis, aimed to strengthen the regulatory framework by increasing the quality and quantity of capital banks must hold, improving liquidity requirements, and addressing systemic risks.

In summary, **Basel II** focused on a more risk-sensitive approach to capital adequacy, risk management, and transparency, improving the overall safety and soundness of banks while encouraging better risk assessment and more robust regulatory oversight.
