### Summary 

This dataset serves as a valuable resource for identifying trends, assessing company practices, and informing policy decisions. 
As of February 22, 2025, the database contains a total of 7,867,198 complaints. The dataset is 1,36 GB in size and available for download in CSV format. The dataset spans from December 1, 2011, to the present, with regular updates to include new complaints.



### About the data
Complaints that the CFPB sends to companies for response are published in the Consumer Complaint Database after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first.


### Complaint narratives
With their consent and after taking steps to remove sensitive information, we publish consumers‚Äô complaint narratives in their own words. One consumer‚Äôs experience is not necessarily representative of all consumers‚Äô experiences and narratives are not verified before publication.





###  Data Dictionnary


| Column Name      | Type data    | Description               |
|--------------|----------|-----------------------------------|
| Date received   | INT   | The date the CFPB received the complaint. <br> For example, "05/25/2013."                       |
| Product  | INT  | The type of product the consumer identified in the complaint. <br> For example, "Checking or savings account" or "Student loan."   |
| Sub-product   | DATE   | The type of sub-product the consumer identified in the complaint. <br> For example, "Checking account" or "Private student loan."   |
| Issue    | DECIMAL  | The issue the consumer identified in the complaint. For example, <br> "Managing an account" or "Struggling to repay your loan."   |
| Sub-issue   | DECIMAL  | The sub-issue the consumer identified in the complaint. <br> For example, "Deposits and withdrawals" or "Problem lowering your monthly payments."     |
| Consumer complaint narrative    | DECIMAL  | Consumer complaint narrative is the consumer-submitted description of "what happened" from the complaint. <br> Consumers must opt-in to share their narrative. We will not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, <br> and consumers can opt-out at any time. The CFPB takes reasonable steps <br> to scrub personal information from each complaint that could be used to identify the consumer    |
| Company public response   | DECIMAL  | TThe company's optional, public-facing response to a consumer's complaint. <br> Companies can choose to select a response from a pre-set list of options that will be posted on the public database. <br> For example, "Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error."    |
| Company      | DECIMAL  | The complaint is about this company. For example, "ABC Bank."     |
| State       | DECIMAL  | The state of the mailing address provided by the consumer.        |
| ZIP code     | DECIMAL  | The mailing ZIP code provided by the consumer. <br> This field may: (i) include the first five digits of a ZIP code; (ii) include the first three digits of a ZIP code (if the consumer consented to publication of <br> their complaint narrative); or (iii) be blank (if ZIP codes have been submitted <br> with non-numeric values, if there are less than 20,000 people in a given ZIP code, or <br> if the complaint has an address outside of the United States).  |
| Tags    | DECIMAL  | Data that supports easier searching and sorting of complaints submitted by or on behalf of consumers. <br> For example, complaints where the submitter reports the age of the consumer as 62 years or <br> older are tagged "Older American." Complaints submitted by or on behalf of a servicemember or the spouse or dependent of a <br> servicemember are tagged "Servicemember." <br> Servicemember includes anyone who is active duty, National Guard, or Reservist, as well as anyone who previously served and is a veteran or retiree.    |
| Consumer consent provided?   | DECIMAL  | Identifies whether the consumer opted in to publish their complaint narrative. <br> We do not publish the narrative unless the consumer consents, <br> and consumers can opt-out at any time   |
| Submitted via  | DECIMAL  | How the complaint was submitted to the CFPB. For example, "Web" or "Phone."  |
| Date sent to company   | DECIMAL  | The date the CFPB sent the complaint to the company.  |
| Company response to consumer  | DECIMAL  | This is how the company responded. For example, "Closed with explanation."   |
| Timely response?  | DECIMAL  | Whether the company gave a timely response. For example, "Yes" or "No."  |
| Consumer disputed?  | DECIMAL  | Whether the consumer disputed the company's response.  |
| Complaint ID   | DECIMAL  | The unique identification number for a complaint.  |



### Dataset Description:
The database encompasses a wide array of complaints related to various financial sectors, including debt collection, credit reporting, mortgages, credit cards, and more. Each week we send thousands of consumers' complaints about financial products and services to companies for response. Those complaints are published here after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first. Complaint narratives are consumers' descriptions of their experiences in their own words. By adding their voice, consumers help improve the financial marketplace. The database generally updates daily.  Each complaint entry includes details such as the date received, product type, issue, company involved, consumer's narrative (if consented for publication), company response, and the complaint's current status. This dataset serves as a valuable resource for identifying trends, assessing company practices, and informing policy decisions. 
As of February 22, 2025, the database contains a total of 7,867,198 complaints. The dataset is 1,36 GB in size and available for download in CSV format. The dataset spans from December 1, 2011, to the present, with regular updates to include new complaints.

Great question! For a dataset containing **consumer complaints** (with millions of rows, spanning from 2011 to 2025), you‚Äôll want MySQL queries that help you extract insights, track trends, identify problematic companies, and monitor complaint resolution. Below is a list of **high-value query types** organized by analysis goals, along with why they‚Äôre useful.

---

### üîç **1. Data Overview & Integrity**

#### ‚úÖ Total Number of Complaints

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_complaints FROM complaints;
```

#### ‚úÖ Complaints Over Time

```sql
SELECT YEAR(received_date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS complaints_count
FROM complaints
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
```

#### ‚úÖ Range of Complaint Dates

```sql
SELECT MIN(received_date) AS earliest, MAX(received_date) AS latest FROM complaints;
```

---

### üìä **2. Trend Analysis**

#### ‚úÖ Monthly Complaint Volume

```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(received_date, '%Y-%m') AS month, COUNT(*) AS complaints
FROM complaints
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
```

#### ‚úÖ Year-over-Year Growth

```sql
SELECT YEAR(received_date) AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS complaints,
       LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(received_date)) AS prev_year,
       ROUND((COUNT(*) - LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(received_date))) / 
              LAG(COUNT(*)) OVER (ORDER BY YEAR(received_date)) * 100, 2) AS percent_change
FROM complaints
GROUP BY year;
```

---

### üè¢ **3. Company Performance**

SELECT company, COUNT(*) AS total_complaints
FROM complaints
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY total_complaints DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### ‚úÖ Complaints per Company per Year

FROM complaints
GROUP BY company, year
ORDER BY company, year;
```

---

### ‚öñÔ∏è **4. Resolution & Status Analysis**

#### ‚úÖ Complaint Status Distribution

```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM complaints
GROUP BY status;
```

#### ‚úÖ Resolution Rate per Company

### **MySQL Dataset Summary**

This dataset provides a comprehensive record of consumer complaints, useful for trend analysis, company performance evaluation, and policy development. As of **February 22, 2025**, the database contains approximately **7.87 million records**, covering the period from **December 1, 2011**, to the present. The dataset is updated regularly and is available in **CSV format**, with a file size of **1.36 GB**.

In a MySQL environment, this dataset can be imported for efficient querying, filtering by date ranges, company names, complaint types, and other dimensions. Proper indexing, partitioning (e.g., by year or month), and normalization can greatly enhance performance and storage efficiency when analyzing this volume of data.








**Notes:**
- Orders only include completed purchases (not abandoned carts).
- Use `order_date` for time-based reporting.

About the database
What‚Äôs published and when
98% of complaints sent to companies get timely responses

Only complaints sent to companies for response are eligible to be published and are only published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship or after 15 days, whichever comes first. The database generally updates daily.

We do not publish complaints referred to other regulators, such as complaints about depository institutions with less than $10 billion in assets.

We publish the consumer‚Äôs narrative description from their complaint if the consumer opts to share it publicly and after the Bureau takes steps to remove personal information.

This database is not a statistical sample of consumers‚Äô experiences in the marketplace and these complaints are not necessarily representative of all consumers‚Äô experiences with a financial product or company. Complaints are not ‚Äúinformation‚Äù for purposes of the Information Quality Act.

See publication criteria 
More about the data we publish
Understanding complaint volume
The lack of complaints or a relatively low number of complaints published in the database about a product, issue, or company does not necessarily mean there is little or no consumer harm. Depending on the nature of the financial product and how consumers use the product, consumers may be harmed in ways that do not cause them to complain to the Bureau or to blame the product or provider for the harm they have suffered.

When looking at complaint volume about a company or product, consider company size and/or market share. For example, companies with more customers may have more complaints than companies with fewer customers.

When looking at complaint volume for a state or ZIP code, consider the population in that geography.

We encourage you to pair complaint data with public and private data sets for additional context.

Learn about past changes to the database
Viewing trends
Recent complaint data and trends will not yet include all complaints eligible for publication to allow companies 15 days to respond.

View trends
Reading complaints
Complaint narratives are consumers‚Äô descriptions of their experiences in their own words. Consider what conclusions may be fairly drawn from reading consumers‚Äô descriptions of their experiences. We do not adopt their views or verify that their experiences are accurate or unbiased.

Recent complaint data will not include all complaint narratives eligible for publication until we have completed our steps to remove personal information from each consumer narrative.

How we use complaint data
Complaints can give us insights into problems people are experiencing in the marketplace and help us regulate consumer financial products and services under existing federal consumer financial laws, enforce those laws judiciously, and educate and empower consumers to make informed financial decisions.

Past product and issue changes
When we make changes to products, sub-products, issues, and sub-issues we provide detailed information here. Most changes are updates to the organization of products and issues or wording changes to make the issues easier for consumers to understand.

The Consumer Complaint Database shows the consumer's original products, sub-products, issues, and sub-issues selections consistent with the options available on the form at the time the consumer submitted the complaint.

Below are a collection of updates by year, including full lists of complaint form products, sub-products, issues, and sub-issues.
