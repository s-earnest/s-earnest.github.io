# What is Monte Carlo simulation?

Monte Carlo simulation uses random sampling from input probability distribution to similate data for a mathematical model that can evalute and optimize the outcome.
This is used to improve product or service by using simulated data. 

This simulation is a computational tecnique used to understand the impact of uncertanty and variability in problems. It involves running multiple simulations to model behavior of complex system. 
This method is useful for decision-making under uncertaintly, risk assessment, optimization and evaluation the robusteness of models.



<!---

If you want to improve your product or service by using simulated data, you can insert and run a Monte Carlo Simulation.
Monte Carlo simulation uses repeated random sampling to simulate data for a given mathematical model and evaluate
and optimize the outcome.
1. Choose Insert > Monte Carlo Simulation.
2. After you insert a Monte Carlo simulation, there are four main steps to running a simulation in desktop app.
a. Define the model and run the simulation. Enter the variables and the response equation manually, or click Import
Models from Minitab and import them from a Minitab 19 project.

# What is parameter optimization?
Parameter optimization identifies optimal settings for the inputs that you can control. Companion searches a range of
values for each input to find settings that meet the defined objective and lead to better performance of the system.

# What is sensitivity analysis?
Sensitivity analysis identifies inputs that have little effect on the variation of the output, or inputs that reduce the variation
of the output. Companion displays a graph that shows the effect of changing the input standard deviation on the percent
of output that is out of spec.

# What's next
Now that you have added some tools to the Roadmap and completed the first phase of your project, you can submit your
project for phase review and share it with others

Monte Carlo simulation is particularly useful in several scenarios:

1. **Complex Systems:** When dealing with systems that are too complex to model using deterministic methods due to numerous variables and interactions.

2. **Uncertainty and Risk Assessment:** To assess the range of possible outcomes and their probabilities when input parameters have uncertainty or variability.

3. **Decision-Making:** When making decisions under uncertainty and needing to quantify risks and potential outcomes.

4. **Optimization:** In optimization problems where the objective function or constraints involve probabilistic elements.

5. **Model Validation:** To test and validate the robustness of models by generating a large number of scenarios.

6. **Financial Modeling:** In finance, for pricing options, simulating stock price movements, and evaluating portfolio risk.

7. **Engineering and Design:** For analyzing reliability, performance, and safety of designs under various conditions.

8. **Medicine and Biology:** In pharmacokinetics, epidemiology, and genetics to model complex biological systems and assess treatment effectiveness.
