### Summary



This workflow demonstrates how to perform text mining in Designer, using a NASA PDF document about pioneering space as data.

1. Run the workflow (Ctrl+R) so you can see what each tool does. 

2. Use Image Input to bring in the data for use with other tools. You have to provide the full path to the directory that contains the image or the full path to the iamge file itself. If you specify a directory, the tool brings in all images contained within the directory. (To package the image file as an asset in the YXZP, we had to use the Input, Select, and Sample tools to import the path name, select the path name as a column to include, and then sample only the first row of data. Unless you plan to package a PDF in a YXZP, you can ignore those tools for purposes of this One Model Example.)

3. Use Image to Text to read text into the Text Mining tools. Make sure to identify the language of the text in the image.

4. Use Sentiment Analysis to determine the sentiment of the text you're analyzing. The tool requires you to select an algorithm to perform the analysis and the column you want to analyze. The other parameters are optional, but can improve performance. If you select the connected Browse tool, you can see that the algorithm has determined that the language in the PDF is primarily neutral.

5. Before you perform any text analyses other than sentiment analysis, use Text Pre-processing to clean up the data. (We recommend that you don't clean up data for sentiment analysis because many sentiment-analysis algorithms rely on features found in unprocessed data.) You have to specify the language and text you want to process. The other parameters are optional. However, converting words to their roots and filtering out unwanted characters are usually helpful, but if you do convert words to their roots, don't remove punctuation because the algorithm relies on punctuation to identify sentences. The Stop Words option filters a list of default stop words (available on the Help site). You can filter other stop words by entering them into the text field.

6. Use the Topic Modeling tool to identify topics in the data. You have to identify the data you want to analyze, the number of topics you want to extract from the data, and what kind of output you want to create as a report. The other options in the tool are predefined. In this example, the R anchor shows an interactive chart that allows you to explore the data.

7. Use the word cloud to quickly analyze text input. You have to specify what data you want to use to create the word cloud. All other parameters are predefined or optional.

EXAMPLE 

Sure, here's an example of how text mining can be applied in a real-world scenario:

**Example: Customer Feedback Analysis**

Imagine a retail company that sells electronic gadgets online. They receive a large volume of customer reviews and feedback on their products through their website, social media channels, and customer service interactions. Text mining can be employed to analyze this unstructured textual data to extract valuable insights.

1. **Data Collection:** The company collects customer reviews, comments, and feedback from various sources, including product reviews on their website, comments on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and emails from customer service interactions.

2. **Text Preprocessing:** The collected text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization (breaking text into words), removal of stopwords (common words like "and", "the", "is"), stemming or lemmatization (reducing words to their base forms), and normalization (converting text to lowercase).

3. **Sentiment Analysis:** The text mining process includes sentiment analysis to determine the sentiment expressed in each customer review or comment. Sentiment analysis algorithms classify the sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral based on the language used in the text. For example, a review might express positive sentiment if it contains words like "excellent", "great", or "satisfied", and negative sentiment if it contains words like "poor", "disappointed", or "problem".

4. **Topic Modeling:** Topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) can be applied to identify the main topics or themes discussed in the customer feedback. This helps the company understand the most common issues, concerns, or features that customers are talking about across different products.

5. **Insights Generation:** By analyzing the results of sentiment analysis and topic modeling, the company can derive actionable insights. For example:
   - They might discover that customers are particularly satisfied with the performance of a specific product line but have concerns about its durability.
   - They might identify recurring issues or complaints related to customer service or delivery times.
   - They could uncover emerging trends or preferences among customers that could influence future product development or marketing strategies.

6. **Decision Making:** Armed with these insights, the company can make data-driven decisions to improve their products, services, and customer experience. They can prioritize areas for improvement, address customer concerns more effectively, and tailor their marketing strategies to better meet customer expectations.

In summary, text mining in this example enables the retail company to harness the power of customer feedback to gain actionable insights, enhance customer satisfaction, and drive business growth. By analyzing large volumes of unstructured text data, they can understand customer sentiments, identify trends, and make informed decisions to stay competitive in the market.
