We spend a lot of time working on things that nobody else knows that exist, and this is because in order to other people see that tip of the iceberg and see how beautiful it is high and beautiful. This is because they ignore how hard it is the design a simpler process.

People have a tendency to forget that iceberg pic is supported by the 90% of the invisible underwater part that nobody sees. The bigger we scale, the bigger the iceberg, and the better the design, and the simpler should appear to everyone else.

A great design makes the world thinking that the underwater part of the iceberg doesn't exist. But it does, and it is very hard to design it.

We decided how to get there and how we can design the ground of 90% of our infrastructure is the essential as critical to understand how our teams stuck and why, and why we produce not value to our partners that we try to help. For that we need to understand how to build the iceberg, and for that it requires a different approach of framing our priorities, it requires thinking out the box, and focusing on the right strategy to construct the iceberg, rather than lacking the right skills.

Nonetheless, we need to understand the benefits of automation and in what areas to focus on areas of automation so we can scale performances. In any organization, the processes are taking most widely of time and effort. But the automation has the potential to make noteworthy increase efficiency as well as accuracy. Automation essentially helps us to streamline repetitive and mundane tasks, and will help us to cut down our SLA. SMART goals help us to track progress, improve motivation, and increase productivity in a team's level. Once we have set up the goals on paper, we can start thinking on everything else it needs to be done to achieve them. These can include business goals, habits for self-improvement, personal projects, and daily responsibilities.

Keeping track of time for each task is critical to get throughout the day, and helps to get an idea on the average day, and get insights on what activities consume us most of our time in real time. After tracking the time, we need to have enough data to gamer the valuable insights and start using the time log for each account and task to develop an ideal productivity strategy.
