So, I would love to talk to you about how to move fast and fix things. And I’ll tell you the reason that Anne and I wrote this book – and it’s really a quest we’ve been on – is that Mark Zuckerberg, in his IPO for Facebook, famously said, “we’re going to move fast and break things.” And the problem with that is that it gave the world a false trade-off. It convinced so many of us that you could either move fast and break things or you could take care of people, one or the other. And we have found that there is a third, much better way. And that is, we can move even faster if we fix things along the way. And so, that’s what I’d love to talk to you about right now. And the way that we think about this is that if you want to move fast and fix things, we have to do it on a foundation of trust. And so, the first thing to do is to experience high trust. And we’re going to talk about how to build trust. But the way we see the world can be described in this grid. And in the presence of trust, we can move really fast. That’s how we move fast and fix things. We call it accelerating excellence. It’s only when we’re in the presence of low trust that we move fast and break things, or what we call being reckless disruption. And as I said, so many organizations are afraid of reckless disruption that they actually end up in this state of responsible stewardship, which is really just going slowly. And so, we wrote the book to get those that are in responsible stewardship to realize that we could go across the way to accelerating excellence. And we didn’t have to go down to reckless disruption. 

So, the way that we think about this, and it’s the way we wrote the book, is that there’s a five-step plan to do it. We organized the book for days of the week. We think that the metabolic rate of organizations can be improved significantly and that many, many hard problems can be solved in just one week. So, we wrote the book in the structure of a week. Step one is we have to find our real problem, that if we’re… for far too many of us, we’re addressing the symptom and not the cause. At any problem, there’s going to be trust broken at the bottom of it. And we’re going to solve for trust. We’re then going to learn how to get more perspectives to make our plans even better. Learn how to tell a narrative that works. And then, and only then, on Friday, do we get to go as fast as we can. And what typically happens in the move fast and break things is that we move Friday too forward in the week. So, our goal is to put ourselves in a position to move fast. And you have to wait till Friday to do that. 

So, what do I mean by finding the real problem? Most of us, a problem gets presented as a symptom. So, I’ll give you a recent example that got presented to me and Anne. We got called by a company. And they said, we’re having a gender problem. Will you come in and help us? And we’ve been able to help many organizations solve gender problems. So, we go in there. And we just wanted to make sure that they really did have a gender problem. The symptoms were super clear. There were no women at the top of the organization. Not very many women were coming into the organization. And great women were leaving the organization. So, they had… it looked like a gender problem. But it took, I don’t know, an hour. It took 60 minutes, certainly not even all of Monday, to uncover that their actual problem was not a gender problem. Their actual problem was a communication problem. And if we did all of the things that we know exist in our gender tool kit on how to fix gender, that would have all been wasted effort. But instead, what we found out is that the founders of this organization, and they were two cofounders, and they were very similar to each other, and they’d worked together and known each other for decades. They had a really uncomfortably and aggressively direct communication style. That communication style repelled all women and most men. So yes, the symptoms were gender. 

But oh, my goodness, the cause was that the two founders were succumbing to a problem many of us succumb to, which is, we were treating others as we like to be treated. They loved to be treated with aggressively direct communication. But nobody else loved it. And when we simply confronted them with that and taught them that instead of treating others as you want to be treated, now it’s a puzzle. Find out how they want to be treated, and treat them that way. Gets fixed. And all of a sudden, women and lots of other men are flowing to the organization. So, Monday… and we take a whole day for this. Let’s make sure we’re solving the real problem. And symptoms are rarely the cause. So, we just want to do some due diligence, some due diligence there. Once we know we’re solving for the real problem, there’s going to be trust broken down somewhere in the… amidst the problem. 

Well, very fortunately, we now understand trust super well. If I’m going to earn your trust, you will have an involuntary reaction of trusting me if you experience my authenticity, logic, and empathy all at the same time. When these three things are present, you will trust me. But if any one of these three is missing, you will not trust me. And here’s the catch. If trust is broken, and we know it’s only ever broken for one of these three reasons, we need to know which of the three, because the prescriptions to solve a broken authenticity pillar versus logic pillar versus empathy pillar, they’re entirely different from one another. So, you can think about rebuilding trust. It’s just a matching game. Know which one is at stake. And then bring in the curated prescription for that. There is a myth about trust that it takes a lifetime to build and a moment to destroy. And then you can never rebuild it. None of those things are true, that we can actually build trust very quickly when we understand the architecture of it. We can rebuild it quickly and just as strong as it was before. So, this notion that trust is a Faberge egg, it’s catchy and not true. Trust is being rebuilt all the time. But we want to do it with a deep understanding of the stable architecture. So, Tuesday takes all day. We solve for trust. On Wednesday, we call Wednesday making new friends. And what we mean by that is whichever collection of people you bring to the table who are the people that maybe are on your senior team or the people that you bring to the table to solve problems. And here, I’ve represented a table. And there’s eight check marks for eight seats. I encourage you to bring four extra chairs to that table. If you have eight seats, bring four extra chairs. Point to the extra chairs and ask yourself, who’s not here? Who has a stake in our problem who’s not represented at the table? I was recently in a conversation with our senior colleagues at the Harvard Business School. And we were talking about how to do junior faculty development. And we came up with what we thought were great ideas. And then we looked around and we were like, Oh, my goodness, there’s no junior faculty here. How on Earth do we know if these are good ideas? So, we got the empty seats. We invited people in. And sure enough, the junior faculty helped improve our plans dramatically. The equivalent of that always happens. So, on Wednesday, we want to make new friends. So, one is inviting them into the room. But then the second part is, how do you make sure that their voices are heard? And what we need to do is that when someone comes to the room, they’re going to be awfully tempted to say things that they think we want to hear. They’re going to be awfully tempted to conform to what we’re already saying. 

So, what we need to do is learn how to be inclusive of their unique voices. And the way we do that is by going through this four-step progressive process, which is, first, we have to make sure they feel safe and that they feel… they’re going to feel physically and emotionally safe, I’m sure, but that they feel psychologically safe. And that’s a shout-out to Amy Edmondson and all of her beautiful work there. But we have to make sure that we feel safe. Once we feel safe, then it’s our job to make sure that the new voices feel welcome. You can think of that as table stakes. Then when we’re doing is we’re really trying to move people up the inclusion dial. And here, this is when it really starts to make a big difference. And now what we want to do is make sure that they feel celebrated for their unique contribution. And so, what we’re doing is moving them up the inclusion dial. Now, here’s why that’s kind of hard. Most of us tend to celebrate sameness. And here, I’m asking you to celebrate uniqueness. And what I mean by celebrating sameness is that for the most part, like, when I watch my students in class, if one student says something, and then another student was going to say that, after class, they go and seek out the first person. And they’re like, you’re awesome. You said what I was going to say. They didn’t realize this. They’re celebrating sameness. They’re encouraging sameness. 

So, what I do is I advise my students to not share that verbal treat, that what we playfully refer to as a Scooby snack. Don’t share that Scooby snack for when somebody says something you were going to say. Share it for when somebody says something you could never have said on your own, and that it comes from their lived experience and learned experience, and how they metabolize successes and failures, and their ambition, if they’re lucky enough to have neurodiversity, their worldview, all of that. It’s a beautiful cocktail. Wait till they say something that comes uniquely from all of that. Celebrate that. When we celebrate uniqueness, that’s when we get the blossoming of the perspectives. And what we want to do to make somebody really feel included is we celebrate them when they are in our presence. But if you really want somebody to feel included, and we bring folks into the room for this, make sure that you champion them when they’re in the absence. So, let’s not just ask the junior faculty to come along. Or if it’s a senior team, and it’s mostly men, and the board of directors is coming in, and we’re like, oh, goodness. Let’s make sure we can show some women too. So, we bring some women along. We celebrate them in our presence. Let’s make sure that we champion them in our absence as well, which is celebrate their uniqueness in our presence and champion them in rooms that they’re not yet allowed into in their absence. 

So that’s Wednesday. Let’s make new friends. Let’s include their voices. Let’s champion those new voices in their absence. Thursday, we tell a good story. And stories have three parts to it: past, present, and future. It is really important – if you’re going to change something, if you’re going to fix something, it is critical to honor the past. People that were here before us, if they don’t feel like we see the past, we see them, we’re honoring the past, I promise you, they’re going to hold us back. And they’re going to be like The Godfather movie and keep pulling us back. So, we have to honor the past with clear eyes, both the good part of the past and the bad part of the past. Then we have to answer the question, why should we change now? Like, why shouldn’t we change maybe next week, maybe the week after, maybe the month after, maybe next year? So, it’s really important that we give a clear and compelling change mandate that answers the question, why now? Why not in a little while? I find that if you’re a retailer, and you have the metaphor of Walmart just opened up next door, clear, compelling. 

We have to… that should be our metaphor. How can we be, with as crisp of a language, clear and compelling about why now? And then we’ve honored the past. We have a clear and compelling change mandate. You want people to follow us in the improved future, we have to have a super rigorous and a super optimistic way forward. We have seen so many people be optimistic without rigor. Nobody’s going to follow. And similarly, rigor without optimism, also, nobody’s going to follow. So, it’s our job to keep refining and refining and refining until we can be both rigorous and optimistic. Now, how do we know when our plan is working? Well, here are the four parts of storytelling that we know. Our job is to understand this plan so deeply that we can describe it simply. When we describe it, we want to make sure if I describe it to you, and you describe it to the next person, that the next person understands it as if I described it to them. 

So, our job is to understand so deeply that we can describe simply that it’s understood in our absence. And the ultimate test is it’s understood when they go home and share it with their family. They have the same understanding we want. We find this to be the four-stage litmus test to make sure we have been effective in our communication. And when people understand it this well, then they can act on it in our absence. And that’s when we’re now in the position to go as fast as we can. And when all of that infrastructure is in place, well, then we can go super fast. And there are all kinds of clever ways that we can do that. So, I look forward to opening this up and having a conversation with you.


Yeah, it’s right. So, the Toyota production system would famously refer to the five whys. And they had… and that was root cause analysis, which we all know. But essentially, what they found is that it’s about five… why does this exist? Well, why does that exist? Well, why does that exist? Like, if you ask why five times, they found that that’s how you got to the root cause. We find, in practice, the answer is closer to three. It’s rarely one. So, it would be, the symptom and the cause are usually a few layers. And you want to keep asking why. So, that’s the first thing I would say, is that we want to have… make sure that you’re doing root cause analysis. But the second thing on a specific tool, the tool that we like the most, we call the indignities list. And what you do is that… and the way we found out the symptom is we went to women in this company, because that’s what… they said they were having a gender problem. And we asked the women, is there anything that’s going on at work that just… it feels like it’s just nicking your dignity? And it occurs for… is it happening to you, or you observe it happening to other women? So, you go in search of the indignities list. Every time we do this, you’ll get a list of issues. Often, they will sound trivial. When you start to get convergence on those indignities, we then ask you to convert those indignities to the dignity list. And in this case, it was the communication style. And you know what the awesome thing about that was? It was free.


Oh, I love that question. Thank you very much. And so, I’m going to go to… here is my favorite visual on the amplification part, which is the team I’ve drawn in the middle, it’s a three-person team. And each circle represents a person on the team. And I’m showing that there’s three circles in the middle, that those folks are very similar to one another. And then on either side, we have a team where there’s difference among us. And this is where the underrepresented might come in. If we’re not careful, when we have underrepresented voices, we’re only going to be seeking from them the parts that overlap with us. So, this is when we’ve invited them to the table, but we’re not inclusive of their voices. What we want to do is make sure that everybody feels comfortable bringing all of their richness to the table, not just the part that overlaps. And so, what we find we need to do is be very solicitous about… and same with questions. 

From your perspective, how does this sound to you? What else are we missing? What I’m trying to do is get you off the scent of saying what you think I want to say or even asking you to say what I want to say because it makes me feel better. But I want to be inclusive of all of the gorgeous uniqueness. And this, of course, ties to diversity, equity, and inclusion, which I know has gotten a rocky go of things in the press. But what I’ll tell you is, if I got to rewrite diversity, equity, and inclusion, I would have written it as inclusion, equity, and diversity, because I have seen teams bring… I have seen organizations bring in diverse and underrepresented talent and not get the benefit from it.
Yeah. So, in this case, I want the friend to be someone who is as different from you as possible. So, the new friends. Like, who’s worthy of friendship? Not someone who you’re already attracted to, not somebody who you’re already hanging out with. So, here’s the thing about humans. We really like people who are really like us. It doesn’t make us bad people. But it just makes us human. And so, what I want you to do is seek difference. Find people from different perspectives. And that will be demographic difference, different lived experience, different learned experience. And so, if we’re senior faculty, let’s invite in junior faculty. If we’re all women, let’s invite in a man. If we’re all engineers, let’s make sure we’re bringing in the perspective of marketing. So, what I would say is my guiding principle is seek difference. Those are your potential new friends.

I sure can. Thank you, Steve. And so, here’s how I would think about Friday. We need ruthless prioritization. And what I mean by that is that for the most part, organizations have… that we work equally on everything. We think everything is equally important. But what we know is that organizations that win, they have ruthless prioritization. And they know, this is what I’m designed to be great at. And this is what I’m designed to be bad at. Not bad for sport, bad in the service of great. 

And if an organization can’t discern between these two, they’re going to end up with exhausted mediocrity. And so, what we have to do for our employees and the rest of the organization is, here’s what we’re going to optimize on. That’s half the story. And here’s what we’re not. So, I’ll give you an example of this. And the example is from Steve Jobs. And if those of you that are a bit techie, and you remember 20 years ago, when Steve Jobs walked out on that Worldwide Developer Conference stage with a manila envelope, and it had a MacBook Air in it. 

And he slid out that MacBook Air. And the crowd and the world went crazy, because it was the lightest-weight laptop in the world. Well, he very, very openly said, we are best in class at weight because we are worst in class at physical features. We could have been best in class at physical features. But then we would have been worst in class at weight. Or we could have chosen to be average at both. But then we would have had to rename our company. And then he made fun of another company that I won’t say here. 

So, we will end up… if we aren’t deliberate, we’re going to end up with exhausted mediocrity, constantly getting better at the things we’re bad at, which, without realizing it, means we’re getting worse at the things we’re good at. So, the most important thing we can do on Friday is to articulate, this is what we want to be disproportionately good at. And thus, this is what we want to be disproportionately bad at. And there’s a whole other series of things. But that’s the most important one.


Well, I’ll tell you that if companies are really pressed for time, they skip Thursday. And that’s to their peril, because if we skip Thursday, that means we have to be present. And we’re a bottleneck for everything. That means people need us to translate why this is important. So, I would say that Thursday is the one that’s most often skipped. And I encourage you not to. And then I would say that Tuesday is the one that’s most often misunderstood because of all of the myths I mentioned that we have about trust. And we just think, oh, if trust is broken, we have to work around it, as opposed to going right through it and rebuilding trust.

So, Mark Twain was right. I apologize for sending you a long letter. I didn’t have the time to send you a short letter. It’s the metaphor for all of this, that when we understand something in a complicated way, we want to benefit people from the entirety of our knowledge. And we just throw up all of it on people, as opposed to realizing the beautiful curation and skill that’s required to go from understanding it deeply to understanding it elegantly in its simplicity. So, I think it takes time. It’s also… it takes skill. Like, this is… there are professional communicators for a reason. They’re really good at it. But if you’re on your second draft of something, you have no chance of describing it simply. So, I would say, unless you’re on your 10th draft, you’re probably describing it in too complicated of a way.

Yeah. Yeah, so I’ll tell you, when we’ve been successful, it’s when organizations come to us, and they say, here’s our problem. Will you help us? When we’ve been unsuccessful is when we go to the organizations, and we’re like, we think you’re having a problem. So, pull works. Push doesn’t. So, the only thing we can’t provide is the desire to change. And so, I would say personally, make sure there’s an opening. And then you can be super helpful in fixing a problem. And I also would say that all of this applies to yourself. I mean, that ruthless prioritization – so many of us are trying to be good at as many things as possible – at work, at home, daughter, sister, cousin, parent, friend – as opposed to, I’m going to kill it at work, kill it at home. 

And I am not going to be good… not now. I’m not going to be as good at all of these other things. So, you can either choose exhausted mediocrity, or you can have the nobility of excellence. These things are choices. So, I think all of this applies to ourselves.

Yeah. So, here’s what I would say, Hung, is, ask yourself… I bet you’re trusted most of the time, which means people are experiencing your authenticity, logic, and empathy most of the time. But ask yourself, the last time, or the most recent times you had a skeptic, you had someone who was doubting you, who they were wobbling on your trust, ask yourself, what is it that they doubted about you? 

And if it’s that they doubted your logic, double click there. If they doubted your empathy, double click there. And that is, each of us has what we call a wobble. Each one of us has a pattern where the distribution of these is higher for one or the other. That’s the sequence I would go in. There’s not some generic sequence that is better. All three of these pillars are equally important. But I bet, for each one of us, one tends to be more shaky than the other. And that’s what I would go after. Now, I will just tell you the distribution in the world. The vast majority of us have empathy wobbles, then logic wobbles, then authenticity wobbles. But that doesn’t help any of us specifically. It just tells us we have lots of company.

Yeah. Yeah, and I think that the way to do it is, talk to people about your message that didn’t hear it directly from you. And see how well they understood. That tells you whether or not it’s reaching. So, don’t ask the people that were in the room. Ask the people that were spoken to by other people in the room. That will tell you how well it’s there. And if it took you a long time to describe it, I promise you, it’s not going to be heard.

So, I often find those folks are an education away, because if I can let you know that if I get to benefit from everyone’s point of view, and you only get to benefit from some people’s point of view, I will competitively thump you. So, let’s say you don’t have the moral imperative wanting to do it. Well, the performance imperative… we have found that organizations that are inclusive get a 200% to 500% boost on employee engagement and team performance with no new people, no new technology, simply the act of being inclusive. 

So, the person who doesn’t want to be inclusive, I’m going to ask them, can they afford… can their career afford performing so sub-optimally?

Yeah. Well, I don’t like consensus, so I’ll just… I’ll say there. And so, what I try to do is work on momentum, which is that I want to make sure that everybody’s voices have been heard. But then you have to leave the decision to someone else. So, we want to do is make sure everybody’s voices are heard, and they had a chance to do it. But we don’t hold out until the very last person. We move forward. And then we can retrace and see if the momentum can bring people forward. 

So, not consensus. I would consider it not consensus, and we have to make sure that everybody gets to air out what their problems are.


Yeah. It sure does. And I find that the most important part for transparency is on the logic side. So, if you’re going to say… if you’re going to inspect whether or not I have good rigor, and I have a good plan, I could say, oh, just have faith. I did all of this hard work. Or I could give you a glimpse inside so that you can see the inner workings. Now, I often call it a window of transparency, because there’s actually a cost of full transparency that I’m not always willing to take. But a window of transparency, I think we always need. So, to me, the transparency part is, let’s be transparent about our logic so people can see it for themselves, and they don’t have to do it in too much of a faith-based way


Focus on excellence (and fast!) and effective change management.

In its early days, Facebook popularized the evocative phrase “move fast and break things.” This suggests that a company can’t innovate or progress without causing damage, and it implies that progress, by its nature, is destructive. Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei and Leadership Consortium founder Anne Morriss — also the co-authors of Uncommon Service and Unleashed — disagree with that ethos. They argue that great leaders move expeditiously into the future and fix problems as they earn their people’s trust. Speed is good; destruction is not.

Repair things

Good leaders move fast while striving to make repairs. They take responsibility for their customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders. Thus, the authors say, the appropriate slogan for an innovative 21st-century company is “move fast and fix things.” Leaders must move forward with “accelerating excellence,” constantly raising their company’s value for everyone.

We’ve spent much of the last decade helping companies clean up that wreckage [from ‘break things’] and one of the main lessons from our work is that the trade-off at the heart of this worldview is false.
Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

Frei and Morriss advise assembling a team dedicated to finding and diagnosing the problems your company needs to fix. The crucial word here is “team.” No single person or all-knowing, all-powerful leader can figure out every factor that is holding an organization back. Build your team with people from different positions, levels, and generations who regard the organization with curiosity and empathy.

Gather information relevant to your company’s problems. This data might come from vision statements, investor information, business plans, financial statements, customer surveys, employee engagement surveys, or employee retention records.

Consider every issue from your stakeholders’ point of view. If the company generates only modest profits, for example, shareholders may be frustrated. Customers might be disappointed about a lack of attention or poor product quality. Young employees might be unhappy with the company’s culture and could pursue other opportunities.

Our Fix Map [quadrant is] our take on the requirements for fast, iterative excellence...The map lays out the four potential trajectories of your company: Accelerating Excellence, Responsible Stewardship, Reckless Disruption and Inevitable Decline....where on this framework would you put your own organization? Are you moving fast or slow? Are you building or losing trust?Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

The authors explain that to regain trust, an organization must be authentic and act with integrity. It must always do what it claims it will do, including taking rational, functional approaches to solving stakeholders’ needs. 

Your stakeholders want to believe that your company cares about them, so your organizational practices must demonstrate empathy. As you focus on building and reinforcing crucial strengths, the authors caution, respect your employees’ time and don’t neglect or disenfranchise your middle managers.An innovative company needs a culture that conveys necessary information accurately and embraces creativity and innovation.This calls for aligning the different aspects of your organization, such as marketing strategy and day-to-day culture.

Perspectives

Having a diverse, inclusive team enhances stakeholders’ trust.You want to work with people who can approach problems and their solutions from differing points of view. 

Frei and Morriss embrace diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) as an intrinsic part of organizational strategy because it boosts the company as a whole and benefits people in vulnerable, marginalized groups. Having an inclusive workplace also helps attract and retain talented employees. Promoting more women to senior roles enables your company to address the needs of female clients and stakeholders more effectively. Including more women in the boardroom also improves an organization’s relationship with risk.

Inclusion is the act of creating conditions for other people to thrive, not in spite of their differences as complex, multidimensional humans, but precisely because of those differences.
Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

Inclusion helps company leaders make better decisions because it brings multiple perspectives into their deliberations, and thus improves risk management. Inclusion improves a firm’s efficiency and boosts its revenues. For example, Frei and Morriss report, inclusion increases an organization’s stock price by at least 10%.

Your inclusion plan should include assuring your employees’ psychological safety. Speak to your people or conduct surveys to determine the level of psychological safety they feel. Employees who don’t feel psychologically safe may hesitate to ask questions, contribute ideas, engage with their co-workers, or take on change initiatives. For effective collaboration, your corporate culture must make everyone feel welcome.

A Great Story

Leadership requires storytelling. To lead your organization through change, you must be able to tell the right story about why it needs to change and how it’s going to change. New stories help leaders free their companies from old, damaging stories, such as the idea that breaking things is good.

A change story isn’t only about change; it also should incorporate the elements of your organization you want to preserve.

Start by outlining your company’s positive attributes. Move on to its problems and weak spots. For example, perhaps certain stakeholders have trust concerns and the company needs to rebuild their confidence. Acknowledge any harm the organization has caused and express a firm willingness to confront that harm directly.

The objective of change storytelling is to understand the story deeply enough that you can describe it simply to the people you want to act on that story.
Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

To bring about change, Frei and Morriss say, you must be able to explain why it is necessary and must happen. You might reiterate the problems you identified and outline solutions that require change. Explain how these issues are damaging the organization. How do they limit its future? How can the company repair these flaws?

Outline a clear, actionable, and optimistic way to move forward. And then, tell your organization’s change story to anyone who is willing to listen.

Seize the moment.  Many leaders believe that significant change, by its nature, happens slowly. They procrastinate and defer change. Some people delay change by claiming they need more information or that rapid change is reckless and irresponsible. Others suggest they are stretched too thin or their skills are insufficient for a big change. Sometimes the structure of an impending change can create delays. People will always say they need more time to get ready for change, but they are never ready. Promote “move fast and fix things” as a charge everyone can put into action.

Productive Change

Frances Frei and Anne Morris bring proven expertise and an encouraging tone to bear on the never-obsolete question of organizational change. The authors express frustration at the notion that breaking things is the path forward. They fear that younger entrepreneurs especially will fall prey to this limiting notion, and urge all due productive speed instead. Frei and Morriss, always positive and supportive of rapid but thoughtful change, offer detailed strategies for addressing challenges and fomenting, maintaining, and regulating an organization’s progress into the future. Their engaging voice and deep conviction make their advice accessible and practical.

Francis Frei and Anne Morriss – co-authors of Uncommon Service – offer a kinder, gentler, more conscious path to inspiring and uniting employees.

Harvard Business School professor Frances Frei recently served as Uber’s first senior vice president of leadership and strategy. Leadership coach Anne Morriss is the executive founder of The Leadership Consortium. Together, they revile the conventional wisdom that maintains leaders must be self-centered to inspire their workforce. Frei and Morriss demonstrate the value of focusing less on yourself and more on making everyone around you better. They offer a compelling, unsentimental case for building an organizational foundation based on trust and love. 

Your job is to see the full humanity of the people you seek to lead, including their ability to evolve.Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

Unleashed was a Silver Medal Winner for Best Leadership Books in the 2021 Axiom Business Book Awards and was shortlisted for the OWL (Outstanding Works of Literature in Management and Culture). Forbes and The Financial Times praised it, and Peggy Johnson, former executive VP of business development at Microsoft, said, “…the engaging stories and real-life examples [that] illustrate the traits of effective leaders will help you empower others to do their best work and create lasting impact.”

Empower Others

Traditional leadership narratives that focus on a leader’s strengths and weaknesses, Frei and Morriss assert, are short-sighted. Instead of looking inward, they contend, leaders must create environments in which the people they lead can grow and prosper.

Leadership, at its core, isn’t about you. It’s about how effective you are at unleashing other people. Full stop. That’s it. That’s the secret.Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

Frei and Morriss describe destructively self-focused leaders as incurious about what others think, feel or do; threatened by others’ strengths or accomplishments; always in crisis mode; and pessimistic about the future.

Employee Potential

Empowered leaders have faith in and recognize the humanity of their people and believe in their potential. Empowering leaders give people another chance when they stumble; they tell employees directly about their strengths and about how their behavior positively affects others.

Leaders who create the conditions for others to succeed must take risks that may threaten their own sense of security, the authors warn. These leaders earn trust by offering authenticity, logical actions and empathy.

There is an obvious upside to leaders being informed and articulate, but when it comes to trust, we also crave access to the person behind the talking points.Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

Frei and Morriss urge you to consider yourself before you lead others. They ask you to consider whether you trust your reasoning and capacity to execute. Are you faithful to your core ambition?

Love

Hold people to lofty standards while demonstrating your devotion to them, acting with love. Frei and Morriss maintain that high standards and devotion are not mutually exclusive and, in fact, support one another. 

Hewing to a canonical position that appears in many contemporary leadership guides, they explain that people will repeat positive behaviors when you sincerely, specifically praise their actions. They remind you of the destructive consequences of negative feedback and offer this formula: For every constructive criticism you make, offer a minimum of five positive reinforcements.

Belonging

When you inculcate a sense of belonging in your company culture, your teams thrive. Again offering advice that many authors hold dear, the authors say that building teams means promoting diversity and creating an inclusive environment in which people can be their authentic selves. They urge you to attract and select people from diverse populations, arguing that if your team’s demographics don’t approximate that of the general population, you’re not drawing the right people.

A culture of inclusion has four levels: safe, welcome, celebrated and cherished.Francis Frei and Anne Morriss

The authors underscore that LGBTQ+ employees require a safe, supportive environment, and that you must be thoughtful and respectful if you ask an LGBTQ+ person about their background.

Culture

Frei and Morriss make a telling, practical and unique point: Culture, like strategy, is silent but pervasive. This means you should set a direction, as a leader, and empower your people to do the rest. Culture, they remind you, dictates workplace behavior. 

Culture establishes the rules of engagement after leadership leaves the room; it explains how things are really done around here.Francis Frei Anne Morriss

If you think your culture needs a reset, speak to your employees individually or in small groups. Ask if their experiences align with your cultural realities, andlisten without being defensive – though the authors concede that not becoming defensive may take focus and discipline.

Proceed with care before embarking on a cultural modification mission. To this end, squelch any urge to share any data you collect widely until you conceive of and codify your formal strategy. Acknowledging that achieving the culture you want takes many steps along the road, the authors repeat that the right culture will bring everything together.

Tough Compassion

Frei and Morriss offer an intelligent, reasoned, singular combination of Brené Brown-style compassion and Harvard Business School hard-nosed practical advice. Their tone and conversation style combine these two qualities throughout, and underscore the workable nature of their arguments. This is a paradigmatic, almost definitional presentation of the new and de rigueur approach to management, one that embraces workers’ humanity and leaders’ self-examination. Frei and Morriss do not cross over into Brown’s semi-New Age territory. They present workable guidance for leaders who may be new to these more empathetic concepts and methods.

Frances Frei and Anne Morriss also co-authored Uncommon Service. Other groundbreaking works on different leadership perspectives include Leading Without Authority by Keith Ferrazzi and Noel Weyrich; Dare to Lead by Brené Brown; and Encouraging the Heart by James M. Kouzes.
