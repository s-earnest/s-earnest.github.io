### Summary

This is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the period 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

The purpose of this project is to detect the fraudulent transactions made by credit cards by the use of machine learning techniques, to stop fraudsters from the unauthorized usage of customers’ accounts. The increase of credit card fraud is growing rapidly worldwide, which is the reason actions should be taken to stop fraudsters. Putting a limit for those actions would have a positive impact on the customers as their money would be recovered and retrieved back into their accounts and they won’t be charged for items or services that were not purchased by them which is the main goal of the project. Detection of the fraudulent transactions will be made by using three machine learning techniques KNN, SVM and Logistic Regression, those models will be used on a credit card transaction dataset.
