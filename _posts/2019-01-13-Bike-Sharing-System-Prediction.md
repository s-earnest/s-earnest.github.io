### Summary

Bike sharing has become a popular transport option in many cities because it is green and convenient and an essential feeder for other transportation modes such as buses and metro.
A key challenge to operations is network rebalancing, while facilitating factors include partnership working and inclusive scheme promotion.

### Task

- Regression Analysis: 
	- Predication of bike rental count hourly or daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.
	- Event and Anomaly Detection:  
		- Count of rented bikes are also correlated to some events in the town which easily are traceable via search engines.
		For instance, query like "2012-10-30 washington d.c." in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy. Some of the important events are identified in. 




> ABOUT THIS PROJECT
- This project is about building and sharing what I learnt. I’m crafting my understanding as I learn, and the purpose is to convey it back to a lecture in a simple and easy-to-grasp manner, and sharing what I’m going to deliver.
This project focuses on exploring, analyzing, and presenting ways to enhance City Bike’s business model, offering an improved experience for customers. As a Data Analyst path, I utilize KNIME Analytics, SPSS Statistics software, and PowerPoint for presentation. The entire analysis will be reported in a codebook, and the findings will be summarized and presented using pdf file. Starting with a raw dataset, the project will culminated in professional visualization and clear, actionable insights for key stakeholders.
