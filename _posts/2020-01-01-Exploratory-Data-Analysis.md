Why EDA
	understanding the distribution of the variables
	understanding the relationships between two or more variables
	detecting patterns that can't be found using numerical calculations
	spotting anomalies and outliers in the data
	formulating hypotheses about causal relationships
	information about how to engineer new variables (feature engineering)
	information about possible formal inferential statistical tests
