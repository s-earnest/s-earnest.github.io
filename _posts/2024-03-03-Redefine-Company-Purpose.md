Business cannot live in isolation mode, and making the corporate purpose concrete enough is a first challenge. The old model, what was the leader as the superhero. He or she knows usually a everything, is the smartest person in the room, and too often driven by power, fame, glory, or money. 

Some of our competitor were refusing to sell the xx or the xx products in their store. Our customer are interested, X is going to give us some money to sell their products in our stores, and so it's good for everybody. The idea is focusing on beating, focus on what we are trying to accomplish in the world and try to be the best version of yourselves we can be and see who can hep us achieve that.

I believe that we have a role to play in the corporate purpose. As individual I can make a difference. But I think it's all all of us. Everything starts with each of us and the reality is to pivot the way. I dont say we shouldn't care about profits. But I think that we should treat profit as a very important outcome. Shareholders are people like you and I, we give them our savings, and so we want to make sure that they do a good job with them. But yes, what we have to move away from is this excessive obsession about profits and treating it as the main thing, the main corporate purpose. 

I think that we should start with people in the organization, then go to customer in business, and finish with financial results. If we flip it and if we start with finance we're going to spend the entire meeting on it. Whereas if we flip it, and if we start with people then business then finances, we'll be able to look at the drivers. 

Yes, because we've all realized the humanity of people around us is first.
