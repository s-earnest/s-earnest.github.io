Data exploration and cleaning are critical steps in preparing your dataset for analysis. This process helps you understand the data's structure, quality, and any issues that might affect the results of your analysis. Here's a detailed guide on what queries you should run to explore the data and perform cleaning.

### **1. Data Exploration:**

The goal of data exploration is to get a sense of the data you're working with. This step includes inspecting the tables, identifying missing values, checking for duplicates, and understanding the basic statistics.

#### **Step 1: Get Table Structure**

Start by exploring the structure of each table. This gives you an overview of what columns exist, their data types, and whether there are any constraints (like primary keys or foreign keys).

* **Query to describe the table structure:**

  ```sql
  DESCRIBE customers; -- Replace 'customers' with the name of any table.
  ```

This query will show:

* **Column names**
* **Data types** (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `INT`, `DATE`, etc.)
* **Nullability** (whether a column can have missing values or not)
* **Key constraints** (e.g., primary key, foreign key)

#### **Step 2: Get Basic Table Summary**

You’ll want to know how many rows are in the table and get a quick look at the first few records to understand the data.

* **Query to check the number of rows in a table:**

  ```sql
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
  ```

* **Query to preview the first few rows:**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 10;
  ```

This will help you get an initial feel for the data.

#### **Step 3: Check for Missing Values**

You need to check for any missing data. Missing data could either be represented as `NULL`, empty strings, or just unexpected values.

* **Query to check the count of NULL values for each column:**

  ```sql
  SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
    COUNT(column_name) AS non_null_count,
    COUNT(*) - COUNT(column_name) AS null_count
  FROM customers;
  ```

Repeat this query for each table and column. If you see that a large number of rows in certain columns are `NULL`, you may need to handle this in your cleaning process.

* **Alternative query to check for missing values in multiple columns:**

  ```sql
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN column_name IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS missing_column_name
  FROM customers;
  ```

#### **Step 4: Check for Duplicates**

You should check for duplicate rows, especially in tables like `orders`, `orderdetails`, `payments`, or `customers` where duplicates can skew the analysis.

* **Query to find duplicate rows:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 
    column1, column2, COUNT(*)
  FROM customers
  GROUP BY column1, column2 -- Specify columns that should be unique (e.g., customer_id)
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

This query will return rows where combinations of `column1` and `column2` are duplicated. Adjust it based on the specific columns you expect to be unique (e.g., `customer_id`, `order_id`).

#### **Step 5: Identify Outliers and Data Ranges**

Check for any unrealistic values, such as negative quantities in order details, negative prices, or future dates in the `orders` table.

* **Query to check for outliers:**

  ```sql
  SELECT MIN(column_name), MAX(column_name), AVG(column_name), STDDEV(column_name)
  FROM orders;
  ```

This will give you the minimum, maximum, average, and standard deviation, helping you spot any outliers or strange values.

#### **Step 6: Get Summary Statistics for Numerical Data**

For numerical columns like `order_amount`, `quantity`, or `payment_amount`, you can generate summary statistics to check if there are any issues.

* **Query to get summary statistics for a numerical column:**

  ```sql
  SELECT 
    AVG(price_column) AS avg_price,
    MIN(price_column) AS min_price,
    MAX(price_column) AS max_price,
    COUNT(DISTINCT price_column) AS distinct_prices
  FROM products;
  ```

### **2. Data Cleaning:**

Once you've explored the data, the next step is cleaning it. Data cleaning involves handling missing values, duplicates, correcting data types, and addressing any outliers or incorrect entries. Here's how to proceed:

#### **Step 1: Handle Missing Values**

There are several ways to handle missing values, and your choice will depend on the context and the data.

* **Option 1: Remove rows with missing values**
  If a column has too many missing values or if the missing data cannot be reasonably imputed, you might want to drop the rows entirely.

  * **Query to remove rows with missing values in a specific column:**

    ```sql
    DELETE FROM customers WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    ```

* **Option 2: Fill missing values with default values (mean, median, or constant)**
  For numerical columns, you may choose to replace missing values with the mean or median. For categorical columns, you could replace missing values with the mode (most frequent value) or a placeholder value (e.g., "Unknown").

  * **Query to fill missing values with a default (e.g., "Unknown" for a categorical column):**

    ```sql
    UPDATE customers
    SET column_name = 'Unknown'
    WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    ```

  * **Query to fill missing values with the mean (for numerical columns):**

    ```sql
    SET @mean_value = (SELECT AVG(column_name) FROM customers WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL);
    UPDATE customers
    SET column_name = @mean_value
    WHERE column_name IS NULL;
    ```

#### **Step 2: Remove Duplicates**

If you identified duplicate rows in the data during exploration, you will need to clean those up.

* **Query to delete duplicates (keeping only the first occurrence):**
  You can use `ROW_NUMBER()` or `DISTINCT` to keep only the first occurrence of each row:

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM customers
  WHERE id NOT IN (
    SELECT MIN(id) FROM customers GROUP BY column1, column2
  );
  ```

#### **Step 3: Correct Data Types**

Check that all the columns have appropriate data types. For example:

* Dates should be stored as `DATE` or `DATETIME`.
* Numerical values (e.g., prices) should be stored as `DECIMAL` or `FLOAT`.
* Categorical columns should be stored as `VARCHAR`.

If you need to change the data type of a column:

* **Query to alter the data type:**

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE customers
  MODIFY COLUMN date_of_birth DATE;
  ```

#### **Step 4: Handle Outliers**

If you notice outliers or unrealistic values (e.g., negative quantities or prices), you might choose to correct or remove them.

* **Query to remove rows with unrealistic values:**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM orderdetails
  WHERE quantity < 0 OR quantity > 1000;  -- Adjust based on your context
  ```

* **Query to cap or replace extreme values:**

  ```sql
  UPDATE orderdetails
  SET quantity = 1000
  WHERE quantity > 1000;  -- Capping outliers to a maximum of 1000
  ```

#### **Step 5: Standardize and Normalize Data (Optional)**

If your dataset contains categorical columns with inconsistent values (e.g., `Yes` vs. `yes` or inconsistent date formats), you can standardize or normalize them.

* **Query to standardize categorical data:**

  ```sql
  UPDATE customers
  SET marital_status = 'Single'
  WHERE marital_status IN ('single', 'Single');
  ```

### **3. Example Queries for Data Exploration and Cleaning:**

Here are a few example queries that combine exploration and cleaning steps:

* **Find all rows in `orders` where the order date is in the future (which shouldn't happen):**

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > CURDATE();
  ```

* **Update invalid `NULL` payment statuses to 'Pending':**

  ```sql
  UPDATE payments SET payment_status = 'Pending' WHERE payment_status IS NULL;
  ```

* **Remove orders with invalid order amounts (less than or equal to 0):**

  ```sql
  DELETE FROM orders WHERE order_amount <= 0;
  ```

---

### **Final Thoughts:**

* **Iterate:** Data exploration and cleaning is an iterative process. After cleaning the data, always go back and recheck to ensure there are no unintended changes.
* **Documentation:** Keep detailed notes on what changes you make during data cleaning—this will be important for tracking your steps and for reproducibility.

By running these queries, you'll ensure that the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis!





===


Getting familiar with a new database, especially when you're new to the business, can seem overwhelming at first. However, by systematically breaking down the data and understanding its structure, you can quickly start making sense of things. Here's a step-by-step approach you can follow:

### 1. **Understand the Business Context:**

* **Meet with Stakeholders:** Before diving into the data, talk with business stakeholders (managers, team leads, etc.) to understand the core business. In this case, it seems like you are working with sales data for a company that sells scale model cars. Knowing how the company operates—sales processes, payment flows, product catalog, customer base, etc.—will help you understand how the data fits into the business.
* **Review Business Documentation (if available):** If there are any internal documents explaining the processes, workflows, or KPIs, make sure to review them. For example, look for reports on sales performance, product inventory, or customer feedback.

### 2. **Familiarize Yourself with the Tables:**

The first step in getting acquainted with a database is understanding the schema. Start by identifying what each table contains.

#### **List and Understand the Tables:**

* **customers:** Understand what customer data is stored (e.g., customer demographics, contact details, status, etc.). This is crucial for understanding who your buyers are.
* **products:** Learn about the products (scale model cars) being sold. What attributes are tracked (e.g., product name, type, size, etc.)?
* **productlines:** See how products are grouped into categories (e.g., different car brands, model types). Understanding product lines will help when analyzing sales by category.
* **orders:** This will contain the sales orders placed by customers. Pay attention to the order date, order status, and customer ID—this table will help link orders to customers.
* **orderdetails:** This stores the line items of each order (e.g., quantity, price, product ID). It’s critical for understanding the specifics of each sale.
* **payments:** This contains payment data. You'll want to understand how payments are linked to customer accounts and what payment methods are used.
* **employees:** Contains employee data. You may need this to analyze sales performance by employee or region, or if there’s a hierarchy you need to consider (like reporting structures).
* **offices:** Stores data about sales offices (likely locations or teams). This is useful for geographic or regional analysis.

**Action:** Create a data dictionary (either manually or with a tool) for each table. This will help you map out what each column in the table represents and how the tables are connected.

### 3. **Identify Key Relationships (ER Diagram):**

Look for **primary and foreign keys** in the tables:

* Which columns link the **customers** table to the **orders** table (e.g., customer\_id)?
* Which columns link the **orders** table to the **orderdetails** table (e.g., order\_id)?
* Is there any connection between the **employees** and **offices** table (e.g., employee office\_id)?
* Is there a connection between **products** and **orderdetails** (e.g., product\_id)?

**Action:** Sketch an **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram** to visualize these connections. If you use a tool like MySQL Workbench, it can auto-generate this for you.

### 4. **Data Exploration and Cleaning:**

Given that there are **missing values** in the dataset, you’ll need to perform some basic data cleaning and exploration:

* **Check for Missing Values:** Identify which columns have missing values and decide what actions to take (e.g., fill with defaults, use mean/median values, drop rows, or flag for further review).
* **Check for Duplicates:** Check if there are duplicate records that might be skewing your analysis.
* **Data Types:** Make sure each column is in the correct data type (e.g., date columns should be in `DATE` format, numerical values should be integers or floats).

**Action:** Run queries to summarize the data and check for missing, null, or outlier values. For example:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;  -- To get total records in the table
SELECT * FROM orders LIMIT 10; -- Preview data
SELECT column_name, COUNT(*) FROM orders GROUP BY column_name; -- For checking missing values
```

### 5. **Look for Key Metrics & KPIs:**

Think about some **key performance indicators (KPIs)** that are crucial for the business. These can include:

* **Sales performance** (total revenue, orders per month, top-selling products, etc.)
* **Customer retention** (repeat customers, order frequency)
* **Payment status** (pending, paid, overdue, etc.)
* **Employee performance** (sales by employee, commission-based metrics)

**Action:** Write some initial queries to calculate basic KPIs, such as:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_orders FROM orders;  -- Total orders
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales FROM payments;  -- Total payments
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM orders;  -- Total unique customers
```

### 6. **Get Familiar with Common Queries:**

Once you understand the schema, practice some of the most common SQL queries:

* **Joins:** Learn how to combine data from different tables (e.g., join `orders` with `orderdetails` to get product details for each order).
* **Aggregations:** Use `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, and `GROUP BY` to summarize data.
* **Filtering:** Use `WHERE` clauses to narrow down data by specific conditions (e.g., date ranges, customer types).
* **Sorting:** Use `ORDER BY` to get insights on top-selling products, highest-paying customers, etc.

**Action:** Try the following:

```sql
SELECT products.product_name, SUM(orderdetails.quantity) AS total_sales
FROM orderdetails
JOIN products ON orderdetails.product_id = products.product_id
GROUP BY products.product_name
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 10;  -- Top 10 selling products
```

### 7. **Understand Business Processes & Workflows:**

Talk to stakeholders about how sales, payments, and orders work from a process perspective. Are there common customer behaviors or seasonal trends? Are there any marketing campaigns running that you should be aware of? Understanding these aspects can help you tailor your data analysis to be more useful.

### 8. **Create Reports & Visualizations:**

Once you’re familiar with the data, start building simple reports and dashboards. You could use tools like:

* **SQL-based reports:** Write complex SQL queries for recurring reports (e.g., sales by product, total revenue per employee, etc.).
* **Business Intelligence tools:** Use a tool like Tableau, Power BI, or Google Data Studio to visualize the data and make it more actionable. If you are focusing on customer segmentation, these tools can help visualize clusters and trends.

---

### Summary of Initial Steps:

1. **Get the context**: Understand the business and processes.
2. **Explore the tables**: Understand each table’s purpose and the relationships between them.
3. **Perform data cleaning**: Handle missing data, duplicates, and data types.
4. **Start querying**: Run simple queries to explore KPIs and trends.
5. **Build reports**: Use SQL or BI tools to create meaningful reports for stakeholders.

As you get more familiar with the business, you’ll be able to answer more specific questions and build more sophisticated analysis models.
