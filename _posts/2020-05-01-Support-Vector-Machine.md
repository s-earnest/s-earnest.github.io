### Summary

This is a supervised learning models that construct a maximal margin hyperplane during training to find the best solution for the data. SVMs can employ different kernels to separate the space and ensure further flexibility.


### Inputs

  - Numerical
  - Categorical

### Preprocessing

  - Input needs to be rescaled to [-1, 1]
