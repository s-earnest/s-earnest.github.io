### Summary

Prescriptive analytics is a form of advanced analytics that examines data or content to answer the question **‚ÄúWhat should be done?‚Äù** or **‚ÄúWhat can we do to make __ happen?‚Äù**, and is characterized by techniques such as graph analysis, simulation, complex event processing, neural networks, recommendation engines, heuristics, and machine learning.

It goes beyond descriptive and predictive analytics by not only providing insights into what is likely to happen in the future but also suggesting the most appropriate actions to take based on those predictions.

# Methodology

Prescriptive analytics methodology involves several steps, encompassing data collection, data processing, model creation, and decision-making. Here‚Äôs a typical process:

## Data Collection: 

  The first step in any data analytics process involves gathering the necessary data. This can include historical data, real-time data, or a mix of both. The data can come from multiple different sources, such as databases, data warehouses, or external data sources.

## Data Processing: 

  After the data is collected, it‚Äôs processed and cleaned. This includes handling missing or incorrect data, normalizing data, and conducting other pre-processing steps to make the data suitable for analysis.

## Feature Selection & Engineering: 

  This step involves identifying the key variables, or features, in the data that will be used for model creation. Sometimes, existing variables might be combined or transformed to create new, more predictive features, in a process known as feature engineering.

## Model Creation: 

  The next step is to create a model that can use the selected features to predict outcomes. This could involve various statistical, machine learning, or AI techniques. Often, many different models are created and tested in this step to see which one produces the best results.

## Model Testing & Validation: 

  After the model is created, it‚Äôs tested against a validation dataset to assess its performance. Depending on the results, it may be necessary to go back to the model creation step to refine the model further.

## Optimization & Simulation: 

Once the model is performing well, it can be used for optimization and simulation. This can involve using the model to simulate different scenarios and find the optimal solution. For instance, a company might use a prescriptive model to find the optimal price for a product that maximizes profit while keeping customer satisfaction high.

Decision Making: 

  Finally, the results of the prescriptive analysis are used to make decisions. The goal of prescriptive analytics is to guide action, so the final step involves actually using the insights gained to make a decision or take an action.
Review & Monitoring: Post-decision, the results should be monitored to ensure they are as expected. This feedback can be used to further refine the model and improve future decision-making.

# Prescriptive Analytics Techniques

Prescriptive analytics uses various techniques to help organizations decide on a course of action based on the results of descriptive and predictive analytics. Here are a few commonly used techniques:

## Optimization

  This is a mathematical approach used to find the best solution among various alternatives under the given constraints. Techniques like linear programming, integer programming, and more advanced multivariate algorithmic methods can be used. These methods help find the optimal solution for complex decision problems with multiple variables and constraints.

Simulation

Simulation techniques allow businesses to model a situation and then simulate different actions to see how each would affect the outcome. This can be particularly useful in scenarios where it‚Äôs difficult or costly to test different actions in the real world.

Heuristics

Heuristic methods are rule-based techniques used to speed up the process of finding a satisfactory solution, where an optimal solution can be difficult to identify. These are often used in complex or large-scale decision problems.

Machine Learning

Machine learning algorithms can be used to learn from historical data and make predictions about future data. In prescriptive analytics, these predictions can then be used to inform decisions. Machine learning can incorporate a wide variety of techniques, including regression, classification, clustering, and others.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

More advanced prescriptive analytics solutions may use AI techniques like neural networks, deep learning, or reinforcement learning to model complex relationships and make predictions.

Decision Tree

Decision trees are schematic, tree-shaped diagrams used to determine a course of action or show a statistical probability. They present possible options, outcomes, and resource costs in a detailed, easy-to-follow format.

Monte Carlo Simulation

This technique uses probability distributions to model risk or uncertainty. It allows the analyst to run multiple ‚Äòwhat if‚Äô scenarios and understand the likelihood and impact of different outcomes.

Genetic Algorithms

These are heuristic search algorithms used for optimization and search. They are based on the process of natural selection, with concepts of mutation, crossover, and selection, and can be used to identify optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex problems.

# Prescriptive Analytics Case Study Example

Let‚Äôs consider a case study from the airline industry where prescriptive analytics can be effectively applied:

Case Study: Airline Revenue Optimization with Prescriptive Analytics

An international airline was struggling with optimizing its revenue due to fluctuating demand, changing prices, competition, and other factors. They turned to prescriptive analytics to help address these challenges.

### Step 1: Data Collection

The first step involved gathering data. The airline collected data on past flights, including details about each flight (time, duration, route, etc.), the number of passengers, ticket prices, and more. They also gathered data about external factors such as holidays, economic indicators, and competitors‚Äô ticket prices.

### Step 2: Data Processing and Feature Selection

The data was then cleaned and processed. Variables that were likely to have an impact on the ticket sales and revenue (like time of flight, price, route popularity, competition prices, etc.) were selected for further analysis.

### Step 3: Model Creation

The airline then created a predictive model to forecast demand for each flight based on the variables selected. After that, they developed a prescriptive model that used this demand forecast to determine the optimal ticket price. This model considered various constraints, such as the need to cover costs and the prices being offered by competitors.

### Step 4: Model Testing & Validation

The model was then tested and validated using a subset of their data. The model‚Äôs results were compared against actual outcomes to assess its performance.

### Step 5: Optimization & Simulation

Once the model was validated, it was used for optimization and simulation. The airline was able to simulate different pricing strategies and see how each one would affect their revenue.

### Step 6: Decision Making

Based on the results of the prescriptive analysis, the airline adjusted their pricing strategy. They were able to set prices that maximized their revenue while still being competitive in the market.

### Step 7: Review & Monitoring

After implementing the changes, the airline continued to monitor the outcomes to ensure they were in line with the model‚Äôs predictions. The model was periodically updated with new data to ensure it remained accurate.

As a result of implementing prescriptive analytics, the airline was able to significantly increase its revenue. It also gained valuable insights that helped it understand the key drivers of demand and revenue in its business. This case study demonstrates how prescriptive analytics can be used to guide decision making and optimize outcomes.
