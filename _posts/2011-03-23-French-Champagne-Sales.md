### Summary

In many industries throughout the world, suppliers compete for business by submitting quotes for work, services or products. A key criteria used to determine the winning quote is the dollar amount of the quote, but other factors include expected quality, estimated delivery time of the product, or quoted completion time of the work.

The focus of this case is to increase sales and expand its market position. Many of the quotes provided to prospective customers in the past haven't resulted in orders.
