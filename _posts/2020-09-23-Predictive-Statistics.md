Definition:

Predictive analytics is the practice of extracting information from existing data sets in order to predict future probabilities and trends. The goal is to go beyond what has happened and provide a best assessment on what will happen in the future. This is accomplished through various statistical and machine learning techniques.

# Predictive Analytics Methodology
Predictive analytics methodology involves a series of steps from defining the problem to model deployment and evaluation. The specific steps can vary somewhat depending on the context, but a standard methodology might look something like this:

Problem Definition: 
Before you can start analyzing data, you need to clearly define the problem you are trying to solve. This could be predicting customer churn, forecasting sales, detecting fraud, or any number of other predictive tasks.
Data Gathering: The next step is to gather the necessary data. This could involve aggregating data from different sources, such as databases, files, and external data sources. The data should be relevant to the problem you are trying to solve.
Data Preparation: 
Once you have the data, you need to clean it and prepare it for analysis. This could involve dealing with missing data, removing outliers, transforming variables, and other data preparation tasks.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
This is the process of exploring the data, checking assumptions, and getting a feel for the data. This might involve statistical summaries, data visualization, or other techniques for understanding the data.
Feature Engineering and Selection: 
Features are the variables or attributes that the model will use to make predictions. Feature engineering involves creating new features from existing ones, while feature selection involves choosing the most relevant features for your model.
Modeling: This involves selecting a suitable predictive model, training the model on your data, and tuning the modelâ€™s parameters to improve its predictive performance. This could involve a variety of machine learning techniques such as regression, decision trees, random forests, neural networks, etc.
Model Validation: Once the model has been trained, it needs to be validated. This typically involves dividing your data into a training set and a test set. The model is trained on the training set, and then its predictions are compared to the actual values in the test set to measure its performance.
Model Deployment: Once the model has been validated and you are satisfied with its performance, it can be deployed. This involves integrating the model into your existing systems so that it can start making predictions on new data.
Model Monitoring and Updating: 
Even after a model has been deployed, it should be monitored to ensure that it continues to perform well as new data comes in. If the modelâ€™s performance starts to decline, it may need to be updated or replaced.
Predictive Analytics Techniques
Predictive analytics techniques can be divided into several categories, including statistical techniques, machine learning techniques, and artificial intelligence techniques.

# Here are some of the most commonly used techniques:

## Statistical Techniques
These techniques involve the application of statistical methods to interpret and analyze data. Some examples are:

### Regression Analysis: 
This technique predicts a dependent variable based on independent variables. For example, predicting sales based on advertising spend.
### Time Series Analysis: 
This method analyzes data thatâ€™s collected or recorded over a specified period to detect trends, patterns, or seasonal variances. For example, forecasting stock prices over time.
### Bayesian Statistics: 
This technique is based on the Bayes theorem and provides a probabilistic framework to update prior beliefs given new data. Itâ€™s often used when we have prior knowledge or certain degrees of belief about some scenario.

# Machine Learning Techniques
Machine learning algorithms make predictions or decisions based on data. Some common techniques include:

### Decision Trees: 
A decision tree is a flowchart-like model where each internal node represents a feature (or attribute), each branch represents a decision rule, and each leaf node represents an outcome. This is a simple but powerful technique for classification and regression tasks.
### Random Forests: 
A random forest is a meta-estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
### Support Vector Machines (SVM): 
SVMs are powerful models used for classification and regression tasks. They work well in high-dimensional spaces and can be used for complex decision boundaries.
### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): 
KNN is a type of instance-based learning that classifies new instances based on a similarity measure with known instances.
### Gradient Boosting Algorithms: 
These are ensemble techniques that combine the predictions of multiple models to create a more accurate and robust prediction. They work by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor.

# Artificial Intelligence Techniques
These are typically more complex and powerful techniques, including:

### Neural Networks: 
These are inspired by the human brain and are used for tasks such as image and speech recognition. They work well with large amounts of data and can handle complex patterns.
### Deep Learning: 
This is a subset of neural networks with more layers, which enables it to learn and represent more complex patterns. Itâ€™s often used in fields such as image recognition, natural language processing, and voice recognition.

# Predictive Analytics Examples
Predictive Analytics Examples are as follows:

## Predictive Maintenance in Manufacturing: 
In the manufacturing industry, companies use predictive analytics to estimate when equipment failures might occur. By monitoring sensor data from machines, predictive models can identify patterns that precede failure. This approach, known as predictive maintenance, can help prevent unexpected equipment downtime, reduce maintenance costs, and improve operational efficiency. For instance, an automobile manufacturing plant might use predictive analytics to forecast when certain parts are likely to fail based on variables like usage, age, and environmental conditions.

Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications: 
Telecom companies use predictive analytics to identify customers who are likely to cancel their service, an event known as churn. By analyzing customer behavior and usage patterns, predictive models can identify the signs that a customer may be about to churn. The company can then take proactive measures, such as reaching out to the customer with special offers or addressing their issues. This can lead to improved customer retention and reduced acquisition costs.

Credit Scoring in Finance: 
Banks and financial institutions use predictive analytics to assess the risk associated with lending to a particular customer. This is done by creating a credit score, which predicts the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their loan based on features like their credit history, income, employment status, and other variables. This use of predictive analytics helps financial institutions make more informed lending decisions, reduce the risk of bad loans, and ensure that customers are given credit terms they can manage.

# Predictive Analytics Case Study Example
letâ€™s look at a case study from the retail sector: Walmartâ€™s use of predictive analytics.

### Problem:

Walmart, being the worldâ€™s largest retailer with over 11,000 stores worldwide, deals with millions of transactions every day. The company wanted to better understand customer buying patterns and behaviors to improve inventory management and sales.

Approach:

To accomplish this, Walmart turned to predictive analytics. They collected data from various sources including in-store transactions, online sales, and social media. They also considered external factors such as weather patterns, which can significantly affect retail sales.

Walmart used this data to build predictive models to forecast demand for different products at different times and in different locations. For example, they could predict increased demand for umbrellas if the weather forecast called for rain, or for specific products around certain holidays.

They also used predictive analytics to understand more nuanced customer behaviors. For example, they found that before a hurricane, not only do sales of emergency items like flashlights increase, but thereâ€™s also a spike in demand for strawberry Pop-Tarts.

Results:

Walmartâ€™s application of predictive analytics led to more efficient inventory management, reducing the costs associated with overstocking or understocking items. It also enabled better targeted marketing by providing insights into what, when, and why customers buy.
