## [Website license](https://s-earnest.github.io/terms//#website-license "Permalink to Website license")

All content (e.g., articles, blog posts, illustrations, artwork, images, and photographs) available on https://s-earnest.github.io is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/deed.en_US){:target="_blank"} unless otherwise noted.

## [Attribution](https://s-earnest.github.io/terms/#attribution "Permalink to Attribution")

If you’re inclined to give credit — a link back to the source article attributed to [s-earnest](https://s-earnest.github.io/){:target="_blank"} is good enough for me. If you don’t want to attribute my content, hey that’s cool too. Just don’t go stealing stuff and republishing it as your own.

## [Disclosure policy](https://s-earnest.github.io/terms//#disclosure-policy "Permalink to Disclosure policy")

I make money on this website through affiliate programs and advertising networks. If you click an affiliate link or ad banner and buy the product, you help support this website because I get a percentage of that sale.

What this means for you:

-   I became an affiliate to earn revenue towards the costs of running and maintaining this website. Where I have direct control over which ads are served on this website I offer only products that are directly related to the topics of this website and products that a reader/subscriber would have a genuine interest in or need of.
-   I do not and will not recommend a product for the sake of making money.
-   I do not let the compensation I receive influence the content, posts, or opinions expressed on this website.
-   I respect and value my readers too much to write anything other than my own opinions and advice.

Like this website, my disclosure policy is a work in progress. As the revenue streams evolve, so will this page.
